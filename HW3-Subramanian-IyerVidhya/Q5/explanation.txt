Comparing the metrics of the two models with and without cleaning the dataset:

It clearly can be seen that the error has increased when we do not clean the dataset before running.

Cleaning a dataset removes the inconsistencies in the dataset and hence provides a better evaluation and hence the 
errors reduce.Hence it is considered an important step for data analytics.

Bayesian Regression Model provides better results than the Linear Regression Model.

As Bayesian takes the prior probability distribution into consideration, 
it becomes a superior model compared to Linear Regression. Bayesian Regression performs better with complex models.
