Read the data into a dataframes for incoming and outgoing nodes and their weights.
These dataframes are then filtered to make sure that the weights are equal or greater than 10.
Then these dataframes are grouped and aggregated by the average of the total weights.
The dataframe is then joined by the node id and the calculation for the difference of the average
between the incoming weights and outgoing weights.
The final result is obtained by filling nulls with 0s and converting the data frames to tab separated strings
